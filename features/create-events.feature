Feature: Create events
    In order to create events
    As a user
    I need to be able to configure events

    Background:
        Given I have a vanilla WordPress installation
            | name          | email                   | username | password |
            | BDD WordPress | test.user@wordpress.dev | admin    | test     |

        And there are plugins
            | plugin                              | status  |
            | event-organiser/event-organiser.php | enabled |
    
        And I am logged in as "admin" with password "test"

    Scenario: Single event
        When I go to "wp-admin/post-new.php?post_type=event&post_title=Single+Event"
    	And I fill in the following:
        	| eo-start-date | 25-10-2015   |
        	| eo-start-time | 10:30pm      |
        	| eo-end-date   | 25-10-2015   |
        	| eo-end-time   | 11:45pm      |
		And I press "save-post"
		Then I should see "Event draft updated"
		And the event "Single Event" should have the following schedule
		    | start      | 2015-10-25 10:30pm |
		    | end        | 2015-10-25 11:45pm |
		    | recurrence | once               |
		    | frequency  | 1                  |
        	| until      | 2015-10-25 10:30pm |
